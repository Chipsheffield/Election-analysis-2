# Election_Analysis
#### ***Warning***--- The GitHub Repository name for this file had to be changed from Election_Analysis to Election_Analysis-2 because in my initial repository setup I cloned the file Election_Analysis into Election_Analysis. The only way I could fix this and avoid confusion was to set up a new repository named Election_Analysis-2 in GitHub. Please be aware of this change.

## 1 Overview of Election Audit: 
#### 
### Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.
#### *The purpose of this module is to run an audit on the tabulated results obtained in a US Congressional election in Colorado for an election official named Tom and generate a Vote Count Report. The specifications are to create a script in Python that will import a csv file and return a txt file that lists the total number of votes cast, name, total number of votes, and percent of total for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Tom’s manager hopes to use this code in the future to audit other elections if it is successful.*
#### *Pedagogically this module will serve as an introduction to the basic structure of Python, and how to use Git Bash, GitHub, and Visual Studio (VS) when programing in Python.*

## 3 Election-Audit Summary:
### In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
####
##### *As demonstrated, this program can be used to find the vote counts, totals, percentages, and winners for any election with any number of candidates or counties using an uploaded text (.txt) file. For future elections it will be beneficial to modify this program to parse out votes, counts, precents, and winners by using polling site information for congressional elections that involve counties containing more than one congressional district. Candidate affiliated Political Parties would find it of great use if polling site results were parsed out to the level of county election results. Also, it could prove beneficial in terms of security if the program could be modified to cross check every Ballot ID with a database of known voters.*
